## Fun fact ðŸ˜®
- The name "Simp" was shorten from "LumineSimp" in Genshin Impact, "StelleSimp" in Honkai: Star Rail,... but when I play Wuthering Waves, I realized that I don't know Rover's (The main character) name so I decided to use the name "Simp"
- In some video games, I also use the Katanaka version of the name - "ã‚·ãƒ³ãƒ—"
